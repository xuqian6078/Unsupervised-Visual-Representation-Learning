# Unsupervised-Visual-Representation-Learning
Unsupervised visual representation learning (UVRL) aims at learning generic representations for the initialization of downstream tasks. 
As stated in MoCo, self-supervised learning is a form of unsupervised learning and their distinction is informal in the existing literature. Therefore, it is more inclined to be called UVRL here. So, which one do you prefer?
